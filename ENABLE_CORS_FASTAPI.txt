# To enable CORS in your FastAPI backend, add the following code to your main FastAPI app file (usually main.py):

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173"],  # Or ["*"] for all origins (not recommended for production)
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Place this code after you create your FastAPI app (app = FastAPI()) and before you define your endpoints.
# This will allow your React app to make requests to your FastAPI backend during development.
